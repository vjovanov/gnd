# AS-ci: CI mirrors the local pre-commit gate

The CI workflow is the remote form of the local pre-commit gate. Anything that can abort a local commit must also abort CI, so a contributor cannot bypass the repository's local checks by skipping hooks or editing through a web UI. This supports §G-no-silent-breakage and keeps the link-checking boundary from §FS-non-goals.1 enforced alongside `gnd check`.

## 1. Pre-commit is the source of truth

The hook list lives in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. CI must invoke that list directly with `pre-commit run --all-files`, rather than hand-copying each hook into separate workflow steps. The workflow may install hook prerequisites first, but the set of checks is defined by the pre-commit config.

When a new pre-commit hook is added, the same change must ensure CI can run it. If the hook needs an external binary, the CI workflow installs that binary before the pre-commit step. If the hook is intentionally local-only, it does not belong in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`; put it in a developer-local hook instead.

## 2. Platform scope

The full Rust build and test matrix still runs on every configured operating system. The pre-commit gate may run on one representative CI platform when the hooks are platform-independent, because its job is policy parity with local commits, not cross-platform behavior coverage. Platform-specific behavior belongs in the build and test jobs.

## 3. Current hooks

The current pre-commit gate runs `gnd check`, including the grounding floor from §FS-check.3.6, and `lychee` for Markdown links. `gnd` owns ID citations across docs and source; `lychee` owns regular Markdown links and URLs. Running both in CI preserves that boundary.
